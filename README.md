# Lingo_Lens

This program is a part of my final project for Computer Science: Mobile App Development.

The bulk of the language processing code came from this tutorial:
> https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mlkit-android-translate#0

I also added some of my own tweaks and changes:
* Comments
  * My personal comments start with /// (3 forward slashes)
* UI Changes
  * Changing the Color and Outline Thickness of the Overlay 
  * Renaming the App Name and Overlay Text using the Resource Manager
  * Aligning the Source Language and Target Language List by editing the XML file
